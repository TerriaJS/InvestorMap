    <b>Explore Northern Australia</b>
    <p>Austrade worked with Data61 to develop a web-based business-friendly and investor-focused guide that provides a general introduction to the systems of land tenure and native title in northern Australia. This included an online map which was launched in November 2015 with data on the different forms of land tenure across northern Australia.</p>
    <p>Following a subsequent series of workshops with investors and stakeholders from the resources and energy, agribusiness and food, and tourism infrastructure sectors, this interactive map has been enhanced to include other key datasets of interest to investors in northern Australia to complement the information on land tenure and native title.  This data includes mining, renewables, infrastructure, soil, climate, tourism and agriculture.</p>
    <p>The map could, therefore, be used a high-level tool to investigate locations in northern Australia where investment opportunities might be considered and pursued.</p>
