Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li><li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><strong>Asset Type:</strong> Type of the network asset. Data presented in this layer is generally only for the Distribution Zone Substation level, although some businesses have smaller distribution feeder regions represented at times. These assets carry the following definitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribution Zone Substation (ZS):</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</li><li><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distribution substations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the asset or investment.</li><li><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</li><li><strong>Average demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the 10-year horizon.</li><li><strong>Data Currency:</strong> The most recent update of the shown data.</li><li><strong>Next update:</strong> The expected date and source of the next update to the data.</li></ul><p>The table and chart shows the available capacity at the selected zone over the next ten years in MVA. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>summer critical</em> asset, this is for the summer season bridging 2025/26.</p>"},{"name":"Plain English Disclaimer","content":"<p>These maps are intended to make data on electricity network planning and investment more accessible and consistent.

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>Note that where 2016 data is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2016. Where 2016 data is shown for a <em>summer critical</em> asset, this is for the summer season bridging 2016/17.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

or lower capacities than what is indicated may be achievable. Each NSP can assist proponents to make informed investment decisions by providing more detailed and project-specific capacity and congestion information as part of a connection enquiry. Each NSP encourages interested parties to contact the appropriate Business Development or Connections team by using the contact details listed in the detailed information for each asset. </p><p>Interested parties are also encouraged to refer to the Transmission Annual Planning Report for each NSP, which provides additional information relevant to the development of new generation projects.</p><p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>The grey tranmission line underlay has been adapted for visual appearance consistency with the maps of 'New generation connection capacity' by Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) as part of the 'Network Opportunity' maps. The original dataset was obtained from Geoscience Australia, ©Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2015. It was adapted in 2017 under the Creative Commons license by the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>It is each left to each individual NSP to determine whether their contribution to this dataset only includes substation elements (points), or also includes powerlines (lines), where powerlines are not presently included for a particular area, they may be included in a later update.</p><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

conditions for that asset. ‘Most conditions’ is generally representative of ‘system normal’ conditions, where no outages or unusual occurrences are present. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li><li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on the peak day.</p><p>This map layer shows the available capacity (as a % of asset capacity) for each hour of the peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. That is, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped.</p><p>A value &gt; 0% represents spare capacity, while a value &lt; 0% represents an exceedance.</p><p>Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment (2016-2025) is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon.</p><p>In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the exact exceedance values are shown both in MVA and MWh.</p><p>* If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Asset name:</strong> Full name of the network asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short name:</strong> Shorthand code used by network businesses to refer to the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset type:</strong> Type of network asset according with the following definitions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transmission Line:</strong> High voltage power lines (including switching stations) built and operated by the transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transmission Terminal Station:</strong> High voltage transformation substation built and operated by transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission line:</strong> Subtransmission power line connecting transmission station and zone substation assets generally built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission Substation:</strong> Transformation substation at the subtransmission voltage levels built and operated by transmission network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Zone Substation:</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider that manages the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposed investment year:</strong> Financial year when the investment takes place. Where investment takes place over multiple years, this field shows the first year in which the investment takes place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset capacity (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity at which the NSP is comfortable operating the network asset over the coming 10-year period. This may be the secure capacity, the nameplate capacity, or some other customisable level that could change year on year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mapped year:</strong> Year shown in the map which coincides with the planned year of investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maximum capacity exceedance in mapped year (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity exceedance in the constrained asset expected for the mapped year.</p></li><li><p><strong>MWh exceedance in</strong> <strong>shown year (MWh):</strong> Total forecast energy exceedance in MWh for the mapped year.</p></li></ul><p>The table shows the hourly available capacity in for the peak day in the mapped year.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Available capacity (MVA):</strong> Hourly available capacity in MVA of the asset for the mapped year peak day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Available capacity (% of capacity):</strong> Hourly available capacity as a percentage of the asset capacity for the mapped year peak day.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Hourly exceedance share (% of total annual exceedance):</strong> Hourly energy exceedance as a percentage of the total energy exceedance for the mapped year.

As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed.

The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly.

The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

DNV GL then used the mesoscale model outputs to create WAsP Wind Atlas Library (.LIB) files and conduct finer resolution 1 km microscale modelling.<p>DNV GL provided the microscale wind speed map across NSW at a horizontal spatial resolution of 1km in a GIS format able to be manipulated by the Department. The wind speed results were provided at one height, 100 metres, above ground level (AGL) specified by the Department."},{"name":"Data Supplier","content":"DNV GL is the world’s largest provider of independent renewable energy advice.

The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

So, to estimate forestry residue amounts at an LGA level, the area of hardwood and softwood plantations at an LGA level was used with the assumption that the number of logs produced was the same for each hectare of plantation.  To convert wood volumes to dry mass, wood density estimates (Illic, et al.2000) for P.radiata and E. globulus were used.</p><p>Residue amounts were estimated by applying residue factors derived from Ximenes et al. (2008), Greaves & May (2012) and information provided by various plantation growers for softwood and hardwood species.  Residues were separated into the following categories:<ul><li>Stump</li><li>Bark</li><li>Branches (>5 cm)</li><li>Twigs (< 5 cm) branches and foliage (all assumed to be left on site)</li></ul></p><p>A proportion of each residue type (ranging from 0% for stumps to 100% for small branches and foliage) was assumed to be unavailable due to difficulty in collection and/or the need to conserve nutrients on site.</p>","name":"Data Description"},{"content":"ABARES (2016a) Australian forest and wood products statistics: March and June quarters 2016.<p>ABARES (2016b) Australia’s plantations 2016 dataset.

The reason for the later time period used for plantation log supply was the sharp increase in plantation log production over time.Since many sawlogs produced from Victorian forests are processed in other states or exported overseas, the proportion of residues processed in Victoria was estimated from the ratio between total amount of sawn timber produced across the state for the period 2011-15 and the expected total production of sawn timber from plantations and native forests over the same period based on the total number of sawlogs produced and sawn timber recovery rates (Gavran 2014).  This statewide data was distributed at an LGA level using spatial data showing the locations of plantations (ABARES 2016b) and regional production data provided by Vicforests (M. Lawrence Pers. Comm.).</p><p>Total sawmill residues were estimated from the number of sawlogs processed using results Gavran et al.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>","name":"Project Information"}],"items":[{"url":"https://calculators.sustainability.vic.gov.au/biomass2018/MSW_Organics.csv","name":"Organics","type":"csv","rectangle":[140.3,-39.8,150.5,-33.9],"tableStyle":{"timeColumn":null},"info":[{"content":"The MSW organics data has been presented for the organics (garden mostly, although some select councils in Victoria operate food and garden organic (FOGO) systems) and paper and cardboard streams at LGA level.

The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of wave power projects.

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints.

To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event.

This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"},{"name":"Updates","content":"No updates to the initial project data are available at this stage."},{"name":"Custodian","content":"Institute of Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) worked in collaboration with The Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, University of New South Wales (UNSW) and The Australian Solar Thermal Energy Association (AUSTELA).

As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly.
