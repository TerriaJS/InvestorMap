InvestorMap
============

The [Investor Map](https://www.nationalmap.gov.au/investormap/) is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies. It is an initiative of the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade), developed by Data61 CSIRO in collaboration with Geoscience Australia.

Austrade is the Australian Government’s international trade promotion and investment attraction agency. It generates market information and insights, promotes Australian capability, and facilitates connections through its extensive global network.

The Investor Map is an extension of the Australian Government’s NationalMap initiative. It aims to provide easy access to spatial and other data on Australia to help encourage investment across the country.

The Investor Map is powered by [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS), a free, open source geospatial catalog viewer. Some of the data is maintained in https://github.com/TerriaJS/northernaus-tourism-data

### Want to make your own Terria Map? ###
Please don't clone **this** repo. Instead, start your map from https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap, which is maintained as a starting point for third-party maps, without NationalMap branding.

See the [TerriaMap documentation](http://terria.io/Documentation/) for more detailed information about Terria and how to build and run it.
