The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>","name":"Project Information"}],"items":[{"name":"Cropping","type":"group","preserveOrder":true,"items":[{"url":"http://calculators.sustainability.vic.gov.au/biomass2018/Cereals_strawchaff.csv","name":"Cereals - Straw/chaff","type":"csv","rectangle":[140.3,-39.8,150.5,-33.9],"tableStyle":{"timeColumn":null},"info":[{"content":"The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities datasets.

The project was partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and was built on earlier CSIRO assessments of Australia's wave energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of wave power projects. The online Atlas has used data from weather mapping, satellites, measuring stations and a variety of other sources, which have been fed into a complex wave modelling application.</p><p>The main findings of the research illustrated by the Atlas show that the potential for wave energy in Australia is great:<ul><li>the preliminary studies show the southern coastline of Australia has a great wave resource. This is because strong Southern Ocean winds generate consistently large waves which travel northwards to Australia's southern coastline. The large consistent swell provides ideal conditions for wave energy production.</li><li>the research shows wave energy could contribute up to 11% of Australia's energy (enough energy to power a city the size of Melbourne) by 2050.</li></ul></p><p>The online Atlas has 3 main components:<ol><li>Analysis Study Area - which highlights the area where it is possible to use the analytical functions of the Atlas;</li><li>Analysis Tools - which include processes that are operated on wave data;</li><li>Wave Model and Context Layers - which contains the wave model layers and other layers that can be used for decisions related to wave energy devices.

Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\nAll survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n#### Definitions\n- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone. In some cases the response was unclear and therefore did not contribute to the yes/no outcome.\n- *Response* - The responses were &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; as well as &#39;Response not clear&#39; where the intended response was not able to be determined.\n- *Response clear* - A clear response is recorded where the markings on the form can be clearly identified as indicating yes or no to the survey question.\n- *Response not clear* - Responses where there is not a clear &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; recorded.

Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\nAll survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n#### Definitions\n- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone. In some cases the response was unclear and therefore did not contribute to the yes/no outcome.\n- *Response* - The responses were &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; as well as &#39;Response not clear&#39; where the intended response was not able to be determined.\n- *Response clear* - A clear response is recorded where the markings on the form can be clearly identified as indicating yes or no to the survey question.\n- *Response not clear* - Responses where there is not a clear &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; recorded.

Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\nAll survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n#### Definitions\n- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone.\n- *Age* - Age is calculated as at 24 August 2017 using the date of birth on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.\n- *Gender* - The gender of eligible participants was taken from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Not further defined (nfd)* - Not further defined is used for records that do not fit in the other categories. This includes (but is not limited to) silent electors and Defence Force personnel deployed overseas whose age and gender were not provided to the ABS.\n\n#### Further information\nFurther information about the survey and the results is available at the [Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey information page](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1800.0).\n<br/>You can view this data, along with explanations of the meaning of terms, on the ABS.Stat website [here](http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=AMLPS_PART_2017).

The project results were twofold:<ol><li>users have now access to terrain corrected surface reflectance from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 presented as true colour and false colour composites and</li><li>all applications using the open source terriaJS have the “screen splitter” and “date picker” functionalities developed, allowing users to make comparisons of imagery for different points in

The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>","name":"Project Information"}],"items":[{"name":"Forest Harvest Residues","type":"group","preserveOrder":true,"items":[{"name":"Plantation Hardwood","type":"group","preserveOrder":true,"items":[{"url":"http://calculators.sustainability.vic.gov.au/biomass2018/Plantation2016-20_Hardwood_Bark.csv","name":"Bark","type":"csv","rectangle":[140.3,-39.8,150.5,-33.9],"info":[{"content":"This data has been modelled to represent the total estimated forestry residues from Victorian softwood (Pinus radiata) and hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations at Local Government Area (LGA) level.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>","name":"Project Information"}],"items":[{"name":"Cropping","type":"group","preserveOrder":true,"items":[{"url":"http://calculators.sustainability.vic.gov.au/biomass2018/Cereals_strawchaff.csv","name":"Cereals - Straw/chaff","type":"csv","rectangle":[140.3,-39.8,150.5,-33.9],"tableStyle":{"timeColumn":null},"info":[{"content":"The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities datasets.

The project was partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and was built on earlier CSIRO assessments of Australia's wave energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of wave power projects.
