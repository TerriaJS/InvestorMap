Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.

This assumes that the point of residue generation for grapes and almonds is the point of processing. <p>The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2014-15 (7121.0) dataset (ABS, 2016a). Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level.

The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period.

Only those sub-sectors that are significant organic waste generators within the Manufacturing division have been considered. This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation.<p>To determine the locations of major facilities at SA2 level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised. The NPI Guide Version 6.1, September 2015 provides the overarching requirements for industries and threshold trigger requirements. Most of the facilities within the scope of this assessment produce high strength wastewaters with high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, which is a trigger that will see their inclusion on the NPI list. Industry-wide generation rates for relevant organic waste streams were derived based on the number of employees, desktop research and consultation with industry. <p>Only those that trigger the requirement for NPI reporting will be included, which are large facilities producing significant quantities of wastewater.

This assumes that the point of residue generation for grapes and almonds is the point of processing. <p>The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2014-15 (7121.0) dataset (ABS, 2016a). Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period. However, this has not been captured in this modelling approach, with the 2014-15 data directly disaggregated based on the geographical distribution presented in the 2010-11 data. <p>Residue factors were applied to annual 2014-15 production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. <p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.
