Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.

Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com. If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.

SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas.

Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\nAll survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n#### Definitions\n- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone. In some cases the response was unclear and therefore did not contribute to the yes/no outcome.\n- *Response* - The responses were &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; as well as &#39;Response not clear&#39; where the intended response was not able to be determined.\n- *Response clear* - A clear response is recorded where the markings on the form can be clearly identified as indicating yes or no to the survey question.\n- *Response not clear* - Responses where there is not a clear &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39; recorded.

Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\nAll survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n#### Definitions\n- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone.\n- *Age* - Age is calculated as at 24 August 2017 using the date of birth on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.\n- *Gender* - The gender of eligible participants was taken from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll as at 24 August 2017.\n- *Not further defined (nfd)* - Not further defined is used for records that do not fit in the other categories. This includes (but is not limited to) silent electors and Defence Force personnel deployed overseas whose age and gender were not provided to the ABS.\n\n#### Further information\nFurther information about the survey and the results is available at the [Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey information page](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1800.0).\n<br/>You can view this data, along with explanations of the meaning of terms, on the ABS.Stat website [here](http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=AMLPS_PART_2017).

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides.<p>The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below.<p>Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. <p>Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. <p>Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. <p>The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. <p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Dharshi Hasthanayake at dharshi.hasthanayake@arcadis.com.

Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level.

This assumes that the point of residue generation for grapes and almonds is the point of processing. <p>The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2014-15 (7121.0) dataset (ABS, 2016a). Data on crop production and livestock numbers are provided at SA4 level (a level higher than SA2). <p>The publication contains final estimates for data items collected in the 2014-15 Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey (REACS). The REACS is conducted annually in the years between the five-yearly Agricultural Census and covers all businesses undertaking agricultural activity (as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC)), and recorded on the ABS Business Register as having more than $5,000 in annual turnover. In 2014-15, the REACS final estimates are based on a response rate of 80% from a sample of 34,627 agricultural businesses selected. <p>To model data at SA2 level, the data from the 2014-15 dataset had to be disaggregated. <p>The Agricultural Census provides estimates for a range of agricultural commodity items  and is presented at SA2 level. It was used to disaggregate the values from the 2014-15 REACS dataset at SA4 level on a proportional basis provided by the 2010-11 dataset. The ABS notes that care should be taken when comparing estimates over time as not all categories or commodity descriptions align between years. The 2010-11 dataset had a much larger number of commodity items compared to the 2014-15 dataset. A manual matching of individual commodity items was undertaken to ensure the two datasets could be compared.<p>This methodology assumes that the geographical diversity in the production of commodities has not changed in the years between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Climatic and seasonality factors might mean that a certain SA2 might not be productive for a particular period. However, this has not been captured in this modelling approach, with the 2014-15 data directly disaggregated based on the geographical distribution presented in the 2010-11 data. <p>Residue factors were applied to annual 2014-15 production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. <p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.

From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD.
