    <h2>About the Investor Map</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Investor Map</strong> is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies.
        It is an initiative of the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade), developed
        by Data61 CSIRO in collaboration with Geoscience Australia.</p>

      <p>Austrade is the Australian Government’s international trade promotion and investment attraction agency. It generates market
        information and insights, promotes Australian capability, and facilitates connections through its extensive global network.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Investor Map</strong> is an extension of the <strong>Australian Government’s NationalMap</strong> initiative. It aims to
        provide easy access to spatial and other data on Australia to help encourage investment across the country.</p>

      </div>

      <p>The <strong>Investor Map</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically
      accessing the data directly from the government department or agency who are the custodians of that data.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Investor Map</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
         <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
         <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see what data is available on the Investor Map, refer to the Data Catalogue in the
        <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/investormap">Investor Map</a> itself. Click the <b>Add data</b> button and expand a category to browse.</p>

      <h2>How to use the Investor Map</h2>

      <p>Just go to <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/investormap">https://nationalmap.gov.au/investormap</a>. Most operations are obvious,
      but you can click the <a href="help/help.html">Help and FAQs</a> button near the top of this page for specific instructions.</p>

      <h2>Contributing to the Investor Map</h2>

      <p><strong>Data:</strong> If you are working on spatial datasets or producing them (such as CSVs which include geolocation information) and you think they would be beneficial, you can contact the Investor Map product owner within the (Austrade) and suggest the inclusion in the Data Catalogue. The same process applies if you spot relevant spatial data on other applications, maps or websites: [email placeholder]</p>

      <p><strong>TerriaJS software:</strong> The Investor Map is powered by TerriaJS, an open source software published on GitHub. You can become a contributor to the code or simply suggest new features, by submitting an issue directly in the open repository. Make sure you give a detailed description of the use case for the new functionalities.</p>

      developed by Data61 for NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
      to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>
