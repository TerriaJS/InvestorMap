    <h2>About the Northern Australia Map</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Northern Australia Map</strong> is an online map-based tool to allow easy access to spatial data from Australian government agencies.
        It is an initiative of the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade), developed
        by Data61 CSIRO in collaboration with Geoscience Australia.</p>

      <p>The Australian Trade and Investment Commission – Austrade – is the Australian Government agency that promotes
      trade, investment and education, and develops tourism policy and research. For foreign investment, Austrade works
      in partnership with Australian state and territory governments to provide investors with information and the right
      industry and government contacts needed to establish or expand a business in Australia.</p>

      <p>The Northern Australia Map is an extension of the <strong>Australian Government’s NationalMap</strong> initiative and forms part
      of the Government's commitment to developing northern Australia. It aims to provide easy access to authoritative
      and other spatial data on northern Australia to governments, business and the public, to support investments in
      the region.</p>

      <p>Northern Australia is a big region – covering all of the Northern Territory and north of the Tropic Capricorn
      in Queensland and Western Australia. It accounts for more than 40 per cent of Australia’s land mass and contains
      up to 17 million hectares of arable soil, around 60 per cent of the water that falls in Australia and 90 per cent
      of Australia’s gas reserves.</p>

      <p>Northern Australia has world-class and growing strengths in agriculture, energy and resources, tourism and
      hospitality, tropical health and medical research and education.</p>

      <p>Opportunities for expansion and growth exist across all these sectors - and in the services, infrastructure,
      logistics, training, innovation, and the research and development that cluster around them.</p>

      <p>More information on the Government's White Paper on Developing Northern Australia is available here:
      <a href="http://northernaustralia.gov.au">https://northernaustralia.gov.au</a></p>

      <p>The <strong>Northern Australia Map</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically
      accessing the data directly from the government department or agency who are the custodians of that data.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Northern Australia Map</strong>...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
         <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
         <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see what data is available on the Northern Australia Map, refer to the Data Catalogue in the
        <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/northernaustralia">Northern Australia Map</a> itself. Click the <b>Add data</b> button and expand a datasets' group name.</p>

      <h2>How to use the Northern Australia Map</h2>

      <p>Just go to <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/northernaustralia">https://nationalmap.gov.au/northernaustralia</a>. Most operations are obvious,
      but you can click the <a href="help/help.html">Help and FAQs</a> button near the top of this page for specific instructions.</p>

      <p>For further information email <a href="mailto:northernaustralia@austrade.gov.au">northernaustralia@austrade.gov.au</a>.
      Feel free to send us feedback and bug reports.</p>

      <h2>The Northern Australia Map Software</h2>

      <p>The Northern Australia Map is Open Source software available as a
      <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/northernaustralia" target="_blank">Github project</a>. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a>, was initially
      developed by Data61 for NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
      to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>
